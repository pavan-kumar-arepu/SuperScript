Yes, exactly! Each of the 14 points I listed represents a main Confluence page. Within each main page, the subpoints act as the table of contents (ToC) or sections of that page.

So for Release Management (Page 11):
The structure would look like this:

11. Release Management
Managing releases and deploying new versions.
